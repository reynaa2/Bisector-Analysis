# Bisector-Analysis
This repository will hold current information on CCF bisectors.
My current project is generating bisector lines from cross correlation functions to help develop routines to identify potential binary 
system candidates from a given database.
The current database being used for this research is the SDSS-IV otherwise known as APOGEE-2.
Bisector line analysis from CCFs can aid the understanding of binary system indentification because it reveals interesting
trends in its shape for CCF whose peaks become merged rather than the familiar binary behavior of clearly separated peaks.
It is more often then not that CCFs of binary systems tend to possess merged peaks.
These are the systems that are tricky to catch.

In this repository are a few things:
1) Code used to generate the bisector curves from the CCF calculated in another language
2) Code used to generate teh slope, linear coefficients, of the bisector
3) Code for developing 2D Histograms of varaible relations that have sparked our interest
4) Images of the trends we have encountered in the 2D Histograms
5) Tables containing the quantitative values for the calculated values provided by the codes listed above
6) Tables containing the points used to generate the bisector curves
